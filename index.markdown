I am a second year Ph.D. student at [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) working in the [RoboTouch Labs](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/robotouch/) mentored by [Prof. Dr. Wenzhen Yuan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/wenzhen-yuan/). My research focuses on computer graphics and tactile sensing. I completed my masters in Robotics at CMU, advised by [Prof. Dr. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/) and [Prof. Dr. Katharina Muelling](https://sites.google.com/site/katharinamuelling/). I received my B.Tech. in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).
