  abstract: Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for objective and quantitative dermatological assessment, but no portable, high-resolution device exists that has been validated and used for depth reconstruction across various body locations. We present a compact 3-D skin reconstruction probe based on GelSight tactile imaging with a custom elastic gel and a learning-based reconstruction algorithm for micron-level wrinkle height estimation. Our probe, integrated into a handheld probe with force sensing for consistent contact, achieves a mean absolute error of 12.55 micron on wrinkle-like test objects. In a study with 15 participants without skin disorders, we provide the first validated wrinkle depth metrics across multiple body regions. We further demonstrate statistically significant reductions in wrinkle height at three locations following over-the-counter moisturizer application. Our work offers a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin analysis, with potential applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and skincare efficacy evaluation.
