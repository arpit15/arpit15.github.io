  abstract: Camera-based tactile sensors have shown great promise in dexterous manipulation and perception of object properties. However, the design process for vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) is largely driven by domain experts through a trial-and-error process using real-world prototypes. In this paper, we formulate the design process as a systematic and objective-driven design problem by leveraging physically accurate optical simulation. We introduce an interactive and easy-to-use design toolbox in Blender, OptiSense Studio. The toolbox is comprised of (1) a set of five standardized widgets to express the optical elements with user-definable parameters; (2) a simulation panel for the visualization of tactile images; and (3) an optimization panel for optimal selection of sensor designs. To evaluate our design framework and toolbox, we quickly prototype and improve upon 2 GelSight sensors---GelSight Mini and GelBelt. GelSight Mini shows improved tactile perception even with a curved sensing area. We design and optimize GelBelt fully in simulation and show benefits with a real-world prototype. The code will be made publicly available upon publication to foster the growth of the co-design of tactile sensors and robot structures.
