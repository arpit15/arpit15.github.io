  abstract: We leverage physics-based rendering techniques to simulate the light transport process inside curved vision-based tactile sensor designs. We use physically-grounded models of light and material in our simulation. We also use lightweight and fast calibration methods for fitting the analytical models of light and material for our prototype. Given a calibrated simulation framework, we propose a tactile sensor shape optimization pipeline. Towards this goal, we propose a low-dimensional tactile sensor shape parameterization and automatically generate the full sensor prototype and an indenter surface virtually, which allows us to validate the sensor performance across the sensor surface. Our main technical results include a) accurately matching RGB image between simulation and a physical prototype b) generating improved tactile sensor shapes c) characterizing the design parameter space using appropriate light piping metrics. Our physically accurate simulation framework offers the ability to generate accurate RGB images for arbitrary vision-based tactile sensors. The parameter space exploration gives us high level guidelines on the design of tactile sensors for specific applications. Lastly, our system allows us to characterize the various tactile sensor designs in terms of their 3D shape reconstruction ability on different parts of the sensor surface.
